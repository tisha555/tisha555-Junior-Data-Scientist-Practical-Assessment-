üìù Summary of Key Insights & Clinical Impact

ü©∫ 1. Anemia Trends
A significant number of patients were found to have hemoglobin levels below 11 g/dL, which indicates mild to moderate anemia.

Most of these patients also exhibited fatigue and weakness during follow-ups.

Clinical Impact: These patients should be flagged early for iron supplements and dietary intervention, especially if pregnant.

‚ù§Ô∏è 2. High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)
Several patients showed systolic > 140 mmHg or diastolic > 90 mmHg readings.

Many of these did not appear for consistent follow-ups, indicating potential neglect of serious risk.

Clinical Impact: Implement automated SMS/email alerts for follow-up reminders and schedule priority appointments for high-risk individuals.

üìà 3. Vital Trends Over Time
For patients with multiple follow-ups, we observed:

An average increase in weight among some patients (likely due to pregnancy).

Irregularities in blood pressure and hemoglobin, especially between visit 2 and visit 3.

Clinical Impact: Continuous tracking and visit-based trend analysis can help in personalized treatment planning.

üåç 4. District-Wise Risk Clusters
Certain districts showed higher average weight/BP deviations.

These could be geographical risk clusters indicating socio-economic, nutritional, or lifestyle challenges.

Clinical Impact: Organize community awareness and health camps in these zones.

üîç 5. Correlation Insights
Strong correlation between:

Age and systolic BP (positive trend).

Low hemoglobin and abnormal delivery outcomes.

Clinical Impact: Use these indicators in early screening to identify patients at risk of complicated deliveries or gestational hypertension.
